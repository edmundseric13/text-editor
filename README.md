  ## Description

  I built a text editor that runs in a browser, it is a single-page application that meets PWA criteria. Once installed this application also runs offline.

  ## Installation

  To install and run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the dependencies for the server and client.
4. Build the client-side application.
5. Start the application.
6. The application should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or whatever port you've configured).

  ## Usage

After installation, you can use the text editor as follows:
1. Open the application in your web browser by navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or the deployed Render URL).
2. You will see a text editor interface where you can start typing or pasting your text.
3. The application will automatically save your content as you type. You can close the browser and return later to find your text still there.
4. To install the application as a Progressive Web App (PWA):
   - Look for the "Install" button in the application interface.
   - Click the button and follow the prompts to install the app on your device.
5. You can use the application offline once it's installed as a PWA.
6. The text editor supports JavaScript syntax highlighting, making it particularly useful for coding snippets.

Note: This application uses IndexedDB for local storage, ensuring your content persists even when you're offline or close the browser.
